## Web Application Description
> The goal of this project will be the create an application that is a relatively simple game that supports multiplayer. In order to increase the level of interactivity between the user and our game, our application will go beyond just the space within the browser. Our proposed application will be a real-time multiplayer rhythm based game that will run on a node server. This application will be multiplayer in the sense that the user will be able to play with 1-3 other people with the option of using their mobile phones as a controller. Rythm Crawl will be a cross-platform, cross-browser game.

## Beta Features
> The goals for the Beta version of our application include:
> * A main menu for the user to navigate between game play, sign in, and leader boards
> * An account creation system for users to create accounts and play
> * Account profiles with profile picture
> * Account play history and personal scores
> * A small selection of levels of varying difficulty
> * Completed UI that allows users to play Rythm Crawl in single player mode using a keyboard
> * A high score system for the single player mode

***

## Final Version Features
> For the final version, we expect the application to include:
> * Users will be able to create a game room for up to 4 players
> * Other players will be able to join a game room
> * A larger collection of levels 
> * Modifications to UI to support multiplayer mode
> * Users will be able to play the game using a mobile device

## Technology To Be Used
> * The front end of ___Rythm Crawl will be implemented using [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).
> * [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) will be used to synchronize between browsers devices
> * A NoSQL database will be used in the back end to store user profiles and levels

***

## Potential Challenges
> * Latency between users may cause issues if the communication requests are too frequent or large
> * WebGL will have to be learned to animate the visual aspects of the game
> * We will need to find a way to have multiple games running at once
> * Creating a seamless navigation experience for the user, as we will have multiple pages including account management, leaderboards, and the game itself.
> * Since multiple browsers and platforms will be used, the CSS will have to be customized for different types of screens. This will likely cause some headache.
