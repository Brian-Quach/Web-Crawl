***

## Team Members

## Web Application Description
> The goal of this project will be the create an application that is a relatively simple game that supports multiplayer. In order to increase the level of interactivity between the user and our game, our application will go beyond just the space within the browser. Our proposed application will be a real-time multiplayer rhythm based game that will run on a node server. This application will be multiplayer in the sense that the user will be able to play with 1-3 other people with the option of using their mobile phones as a controller. Rythm Crawl will be a cross-platform, cross-browser game.

## Beta Features
> The goals for the Beta version of our application include:
> * An account creation system for users to create accounts and play
> * Completed UI that allows users to play Rythm Crawl in single player mode using a keyboard
> * A high score system for the single player mode

***

## Final Version Features
> For the final version, we expect the application to include:
> * Support for real-time multiplayer mode
> * Users will be able to play the game using a mobile devices

***

## Technology To Be Used
> * The front end of ___Rythm Crawl will be implemented using [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).
> * [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) will be used to synchronize between browsers devices
> * A NoSQL database will be used in the back end to store user profiles and levels

***

## Potential Challenges
> * Latency between users may cause issues if the communication requests are too frequent or large
> * WebGL will have to be learned for more visually pleasing graphics
> * We will need to find a way to have multiple games running at once
> * Creating a seamless navigation experience for the user, as we will have multiple pages including account management, leaderboards, and the game itself.
