## Web Application Description
> The goal of this project will be the create an application that is a relatively simple game that supports multiplayer. In order to increase the level of interactivity between the user and our game, our application will go beyond just the space within the browser. Our proposed application will be a real-time multiplayer rhythm based game that will run on a node server. This application will be multiplayer in the sense that the user will be able to play with 1-3 other people with the option of using their mobile phones as a controller. ___ will be a cross-platform, cross-browser game.
